#' Visualizes with boxplots the Importance Index distribution
#' of a set of transcription factors.
#'
#'  For a set of candidate co-regulator transcription factors,
#'  the Importance Index distribution of each transcription factor
#'  is plotted in boxplots. The shape of every boxplot depends on:
#'  the dimension of the distribution, which is equal to the number of rules
#'  in which every transcription factor appears (the higher is such number,
#'  the larger is a boxplot), the variability of the distribution
#'  (the higher is the variability of the Importance Index distribution,
#'  the longer is a boxplot). Moreover, the higher is the median of
#'  the Importance Index distribution for a candidate co-regulator
#'  transcription factor, the higher the boxplot is aligned with respect to
#'  the y axis.

#' @param I a list of Importance Index distributions (IIDs)
