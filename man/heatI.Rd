\title{Generates an heatmap visualization of the mean Importance Index
of pairs of transcription factors.}
\usage{
heatI(TFs, I)
}
\arguments{
\item{TFs}{a string vector with names of transcription factors.}

\item{I}{a vector of mean II of pairs of transcription factors in TFs.}
}
\value{
The Importance index of pairs of Transcription Factors as a heatmap
}
\description{
A square matrix (TFs x TFs) is built. The element (i,j) of such matrix
contains the mean Importance Index (II) of the couple of transcription
factors (TFi, TFj). This is represented in a heatmap visualization,
where the scale color from blue to white indicates low mean
importance of the couple and from white to red indicates 
high mean importance of the couple.
}
\examples{
# Load p_TFs and I_c_2 from the data_man collection of datasets:
data('data_man')

# Heatmap visualization of the mean importances of transcription factors in p
# and their combinations in two elements:
heatI(p_TFs, I_c_2)
