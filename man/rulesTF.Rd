\title{Extracts a subset of rules that contain a certain transcription factor
(or a combination of transcription factors) in their left-hand-side.}
\usage{
rulesTF(TFi, rules, verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{TFi}{a string with the name of the transcription factor (or combination
of transcription factors) wanted in the left-hand-side of the rules to find.}

\item{rules}{a data.frame with association rules and their quality measures
of support, confidence and lift.}

\item{verbose}{a logical parameter. If \code{verbose = TRUE}, a console
message warns the user when the set of rules containing \code{TFi} is empty.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with association rules containing \code{TFi} in their
left-hand-side, with their quality measures of support, confidence and lift.
}
\description{
From a set of relevant association rules, only the ones containing \code{TFi}
in their left-hand-side are subsetted, together with their quality measures
of support, confidence and lift. The function is then used for the evaluation
of the importance distribution of \code{TFi}.
}
\examples{
# Load r_TEAD4 from the data_man collection of datasets:
data("data_man")

r_FOSL2 <- rulesTF("FOSL2=1", r_TEAD4, verbose=FALSE)
