\title{Visualizes with boxplots the Importance Index distribution
of a set of transcription factors.}
\usage{
distribViz(I, TFs)
}
\arguments{
\item{I}{a list of Importance Index distributions (IIDs)}

\item{TFs}{string vector with the names of the transcription factors}
}
\value{
A boxplot representing the transcription factor IIDs
}
\description{
For a set of candidate co-regulator transcription factors,
 the Importance Index distribution of each transcription factor
 is plotted in boxplots. The shape of every boxplot depends on:
 the dimension of the distribution, which is equal to the number of rules
 in which every transcription factor appears (the higher is such number,
 the larger is a boxplot), the variability of the distribution
 (the higher is the variability of the Importance Index distribution,
 the longer is a boxplot). Moreover, the higher is the median of
 the Importance Index distribution for a candidate co-regulator
 transcription factor, the higher the boxplot is aligned with respect to
 the y axis.

\examples{
# Load IMP_Z and p from the data_man collection of datasets:
data("data_man")

# Plot the Importance Index distributions of the transcription factors in p:
distribViz(IMP_Z,p)
