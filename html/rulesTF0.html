<h2>Substitutes the presence of a transcription factor (or a combination of
transcription factors) in the left-hand-side of a set of rules,
with its absence.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function substitutes the presence of a given transcription factor
<code>TFi</code> (or a combination of transcription factors) chosen by the
user with its absence, in the subset of relevant association rules
extracted with the function <code><a href="rulesTF.html">rulesTF</a></code>. Then it searches
for the obtained rules and their quality measures of
support, confidence and lift in the set of most relevant associations
extracted with the function <code><a href="rulesGen.html">rulesGen</a></code>.
A rule is searched in all the association
rules generable from the considered dataset using the function
<code><a href="search_rule.html">search_rule</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
rulesTF0(TFi, sub_rules, all_rules, data, RHS)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>TFi</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string, or a string vector: transcription factor
(or combination of transcription factors) to remove from the set of rules.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sub_rules</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.frame with a subset of rules containing <code>TFi</code>,
and their quality measures of support, confidence and lift (i.e., rules from
which the user wants to remove <code>TFi</code>).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>all_rules</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.frame with a set of all the rules and their quality
measures of support, confidence and lift, to be considered for the search of
the obtained rules and their quality measures.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a GRanges object which contains the Indicator of presence matrix
i.e., a matrix with 1 and 0 values representing presence or absence,
respectively (in case other values different from 0 are present, all of them
are considered as representing presence).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RHS</code></td>
<td>
<p>the right-hand-side of the considered association rules.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame with all the rules in the set <code>sub_rules</code>
in which the transcription factor (or combination of transcription factors)
<code>TFi</code> is absent, and their quality measures of support, confidence
and lift.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
# Load r_TEAD4 and r_FOSL2 from the data_man collection of datasets:
data("data_man")
# Load MCF7_chr1:
data("MCF7_chr1")


r_noFOSL2 &lt;- rulesTF0("FOSL2=1", r_FOSL2, r_TEAD4, MCF7_chr1, "TEAD4=1")
